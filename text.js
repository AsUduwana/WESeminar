    Manual validation is also employed to assess completeness and redundancy in
    knowledge graphs. Experts examine sampled triples to determine whether key
    entities, relationships, and attributes are adequately represented, helping
    to identify missing information. While effective, this process is
    resource-intensive and does not scale well <a href="#r25">[25]</a>.
    Regarding redundancy, manual inspection aids in detecting duplicate or
    semantically equivalent triples, such as different expressions of the same
    relationship between “Harry Potter” and “Hermione Granger.” Although manual
    review can uncover subtle redundancies that automated methods may miss, it
    is typically feasible only for small samples in large KGs
    <a href="#r29">[29]</a>. Therefore, manual validation of completeness and
    redundancy is usually combined with automated techniques to ensure a more
    thorough and scalable quality assessment.
