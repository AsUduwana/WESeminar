    Ensuring the quality of Knowledge Graphs is an ongoing challenge shaped by
    data heterogeneity, evolving schemas, and the absence of universal
    validation standards. This study demonstrated that combining automated
    techniques—such as SHACL constraints, OWL reasoning, and SPARQL-based
    rules—with expert review enables effective detection of issues like
    incompleteness, redundancy, and semantic inconsistency. However, sustaining
    KG integrity requires continuous, domain-specific validation and robust
    governance to address operational challenges including data decay, entity
    resolution, and ontology drift. Advancing scalable, adaptive validation
    frameworks and integrating user feedback will be crucial for building
    reliable, high-impact Knowledge Graphs across diverse domains.
