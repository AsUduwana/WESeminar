        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The web has become more diverse with a growing volume of online content that contains
            machine readable metadata.
            The development of promising machine learning technologies can be used to easily extract the data existing
            in the internet<a href="#r1">[1].</a>
            This has led to the emergence of the concept of Knowledge Graphs (KG). “Knowledge graph is a promising
            technique for storing and
            communicating real-world knowledge with nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships
            between entities”<a href="#r2">[2]</a>. <i> (Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowledge Graphs can be categorized in to open and proprietary types. Open KGs like DBpeida, Wikidata,
            Freebase,
            YAGO and NELL are publicly accessible and widely used in current research context and Proprietary KGs like
            Facebook’s
            Entities Graph, Google’s Knowledge Graph and Cyc are developed by companies to enhance their own
            applications and services <a href="#r3">[3]</a>.<i> (Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The importance of KGs lies in their ability to provide context, connect disparate data sources, and enable
            advanced analytical
            capabilities <a href="#r7">[7]</a>.As a result, KGs have been widely used in several real-world applications
            like personalized recommendation
            systems, exploratory search <a href="#r4">[4],</a><a href="#r5">[5],</a><a href="#r6">[6]</a> and
            domain-specific tasks including healthcare analytics, tourism,
            education and
            production and manufacturing <a href="#r8">[8]</a>.It is evident from these applications that KGs are
            essential for delivering structured and
            semantically rich data <a href="#r9">[9]</a>.<i> (Written by A. Uduwana)</i>

        <h2> 2. Knowledge Graph Quality Control</h2>
        <!--<h3> 2.1. Allgemeiner Überblick </h3>-->

        <p>
            Despite their usages, KGs give rise to quality concerns which may limit their performance in practical
            applications.
            Regardless of the type or number of sources used to generate a knowledge graph, the initial data is often
            incomplete,
            contains duplicates, inconsistent, or even error prone particularly when information is gathered from
            multiple sources <a href="#r9">[9]</a>.
            As a result, assessing the quality of the generated KG is a crucial step in quality control <a
                href="#r11">[11]</a>. The quality of KGs
            defined as the fitness for purpose and quality assessment helps to determine for which purpose a KG can be
            reliably used <a href="#r10">[10]</a>.
            This process of ensuring and improving the quality of KGs are known as Knowledge Curation (also known as
            Knowledge
            Refinement) <a href="#r13">[13]</a>. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Six principle dimensions have been introduced to assess the KG quality: accuracy, consistency, completeness,
            timeliness,
            trustworthiness, and availability <a href="#r11">[11]</a>. Each of these dimensions is interrelated and
            understanding their relationship helps
            to select the suitable validation method tailored to different application needs. The current research
            defines that ensuring
            the high-quality KGs involves not only their initial KG construction, but also the ongoing maintenance and
            enhancement as new
            data and application requirements emerge <a href="#r12">[12]</a>. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This study focuses on examining quality indicators such as accuracy, consistency, completeness, and
            redundancy.
            The evaluation methodologies identified for each indicator were thoroughly tested on a manually created
            domain
            specific knowledge base, to assess their effectiveness and operational performance. <i>(Written by A.
                Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        <h3> 2.1. Accuracy in Knowledge Graphs </h3>

        <p>
            Accuracy in KGs relates to how faithfully the graph's facts or statements
            (usually represented as triples: subject, predicate, object) reflect real-world information <a
                href="#r14">[14]</a>.
            It is the most important dimension of KG quality. The primary factors that degrade KG accuracy are incorrect
            relations, entities, and attributes in the KG. Therefore, appropriate validation methods must be
            performed to detect
            such errors and enhance the accuracy of the KG <a href="#r11">[11]</a>. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            KG accuracy has often been discussed in other literature. For Example <a href="#r15">[15]</a> defines KG
            accuracy as
            “the extent to which knowledge are correct, reliable, and certified free of error”. Some studies consider
            the accuracy of knowledge as a synonym for knowledge quality <a href="#r16">[16]</a>. <i>(Written by A.
                Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        <h3> 2.2. Consistency in Knowledge Graphs</h3>
        <p>
            In recent research <a href="#r11">[11]</a> “KG consistency is defined as the degree to which the knowledge
            of a KG does not contradict itself”.
            Consistency focused on logical correctness of KGs rather than the semantic correctness of triples <a
                href="#r7">[7],</a> <a href="#r17">[17]</a>.
            Our KG contains
            the following triples <i>[James Potter, IsFatherOf, Harry Potter], [James Potter, IsHusbandOf, Lily
                Potter]</i>, and
            <i> [Lily Potter, IsSisterOf, Harry Potter]</i>. Looking at the first two triples we can conclude that Lily
            is Harry’s mother.
            However, the third triple <i> [Lily Potter, IsSisterOf, Harry Potter] </i> introduces a sibling
            relationship, which contradicts the
            assumed parent-child relationship. This semantic contradiction makes the knowledge graph logically
            inconsistent. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h3> 2.3. Building and Validating a Domain-Specific KG: A Harry Potter Case Study</h3>
        <p>
            Generally, accuracy and consistency in KGs can be detected through several validation methods. To
            demonstrate
            practical application of those techniques, we constructed simple yet high quality KG based on the Harry
            Potter universe.
            The graph structure and entity relationships were initially conceptualized by referring the most common
            facts about this
            universe. The formal ontology creation, modeling of the KG, and validation were performed using the Protégé,
            a free and
            user-friendly ontology editor for KGs. This method ensures that our KG adheres to semantic web standards and
            supports
            various validation methods that we apply to assess different quality metrics of KGs. <i>(Written by A.
                Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        <h2> 3. State-of-the-Art Methods for KG Validation</h2>

        <p>Generally, accuracy and consistency of KGs can be evaluated using several validation methods. <i>(Written by
                A. Uduwana)</i></p>

        <h3>3.1. Manual Ground Truth Validation</h3>

        <p>
            Researchers rely on human experts to manually verify the correctness of each triples within a KG. This is
            the most reliable way to find the truthfulness of facts in the KG. However, modern KGs can contain millions
            or even
            billions of triples, making manually checking each triple is impractical and expensive in the terms of time
            and resources <a href="#r14">[14]</a>. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            To address this challenge the researchers manually annotate only a small and randomly selected sample
            triples. This subset is used
            to measure the overall accuracy of the entire KG. If the sample size is too small, the resulting accuracy
            may not reflect the true
            accuracy of the entire KG, leading to potential errors. A sufficiently enough sample size is required to
            obtain a statistically
            relevant estimate, though this increases both the cost and time required for manual annotation <a
                href="#r14">[14]</a>. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        <h3> 3.2. Crowdsourcing</h3>
        <p>
            Crowdsourcing is a promising method for building and verifying a high-quality knowledge graph from the
            knowledge of
            many casual users not just experts. Two primary tasks in this method are knowledge collection and
            verification.
            Collection involves gathering facts from a large number of users through fill in the blank quizzes while
            verification
            ensures the correctness of those facts through true or false quizzes. This approach not only engages users
            but also ensures
            that both collection and verification are carried out efficiently <a href="#r1">[1].</a> <i>(Written by A.
                Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Such manual validation methods are time consuming and expensive therefore only a small, randomly samples
            subset of
            triples is typically checked by experts. Crowdsourcing allows for the validation of a much larger set of
            facts by
            distributing the work among many users and helps maintain the accuracy and consistency of the KG while
            reducing the
            burden on individual curators <a href="#r1">[1],</a> <a href="#r18">[18],</a> <a href="#r19">[19]</a>.
            <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        <h3> 3.3. Human in the Loop (HITL) Validation </h3>
        <p>
            Human-in-the-loop (HITL) validation refers to the process of involving human experts in the KG validation
            process
            alongside automated validation methods such as those based on Large Language Models (LLMs) <a
                href="#r23">[23]</a>. With large KGs,
            fully automated techniques may overlook subtle errors and require domain-specific expertise, especially when
            dealing
            with context-specific or ambiguous scenarios <a href="#r24">[24]</a>. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, our KG contains two distinct nodes representing the characters<i>Tom Riddle and Lord Voldemort
            </i>.
            Due to shared facts such as wand core, school, house, mother, and language ability, automated tools may flag
            these nodes as potential duplicates. However, based on domain knowledge, experts can confirm that these two
            nodes actually refer to the same individual. In such cases HITL validation becomes essential for resolving
            ambiguities that automated methods alone cannot address. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        <h3> 3.4. Rule Based Validation using SPARQL</h3>
        <p>
            Rule-based validation is essential for maintaining the accuracy and consistency of KGs. SPARQL, the
            standardized query
            language for RDF recommended by the W3C, is widely used for this purpose <a href="#r2">[2]</a>. Ontology
            management tools like Protégé
            supports the modeling and storage of KGs in formats like RDF or TTL <a href="#r20">[20]</a>. Competency
            questions, which define the requirements
            for the KG are first formulated in natural language and then translated into SPARQL queries. Once queries
            are formed, we can
            use them to execute against the KG to validate it’s structure and content. For instance, a properly
            constructed SPARQL query
            can check if all instances of a class have required properties, or if there are any logical contradictions
            <a href="#r7">[7]</a>. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            A SPARQL constraint was implemented to ensure that no character could be both academic
            staff and a student simultaneously. The query was implemented within the Protégé SPARQL editor as follows;
            <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>


        <figure>
            <img src="query01.png" alt="Query 01" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Query 01</strong>: Select every character that has been incorrectly assigned to both the
                academic staff (hp:AcademicStaff) and student (hp:Student) roles at the same time.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>



        <p> Another SPARQL constraint was used to validate that each character is assigned one blood status at a time.
            <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="query02.png" alt="Query 02" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Query 02</strong>: The query groups characters by their identifier and counts how many blood
                statuses (hp:hasBloodStatus) are assigned to each one. It returns only characters who have been assigned
                more than one blood status are returned.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>3.5. Schema Based Validation using SHACL </h3>
        <p> Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a W3C-recommendation for defining constraints over RDF data <a
                href="#r3">[3]</a>.
            Quality metrics such as accuracy and consistency can be ensured by using SHACL as a validation language.
            SHACL enables schema like structures known as shapes to validate a KG. Through the application of these
            shapes,
            large volumes of data can be filtered and validated, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the KG <a
                href="#r21">[21]</a>. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i></p>

        <p> The SHACL Core Vocabulary distinguishes between two main types of shapes as node shapes and property shapes
            <a href="#r24">[24]</a>.
            Node shapes are applied to a set of nodes within an RDF data graph, referred to as focus nodes. Property
            shapes, on
            the other hand, validate the values of particular properties associated with these focus nodes <a
                href="#r24">[24]</a>.
            Target specifications are used to define which nodes in the RDF graph are selected <a href="#r3">[3],</a> <a
                href="#r22">[22].</a> <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>

        <p> To demonstrate SHACL validation we created several SHACL shapes to ensure accuracy and
            consistency of our KG based on Harry Potter Universe. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i></p>

        <figure>
            <img src="shape01.png" alt="Shape 01" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>SHACL Shape 01 </strong>: Character must belong to one of the known houses
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            This validation rule applies to all instances of the hp:Character class in ourKG. It checks the
            property hp:belongsToHouse for each character to ensure that its value is one of the four houses
            listed in the SHACL shape. If this condition is not met, the validation process will report an error with
            the
            specified message in the validation report. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="shape 02.png" alt="Shape 02" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>SHACL Shape 02 </strong>: Hermione Granger must belong to the house of Gryffindor
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            This SHACL shape targets the node of Hermione Granger (hp:HermioneGranger) and checks the property
            hp:belongsToHouse
            for Hermione Granger has the value hp:Gryffindor. If this condition is not met, the validation process will
            report
            an error with the specified message in the validation report. <i>(Written by A. Uduwana)</i>
